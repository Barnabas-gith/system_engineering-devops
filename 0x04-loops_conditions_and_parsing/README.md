## Directory: 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing

This directory includes scripts focusing on loops, conditional statements, and parsing in shell scripting.

### Structure

- Each task is implemented in a unique script file.
- Script filenames match the task names exactly, e.g.:
  - 0-RSA_public_key.pub
  - 1-for_best_school
- All scripts begin with the shebang #!/bin/bash.
- Scripts are executable and designed to be concise and efficient.

### How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory:
   cd 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing
3. Give execute permission to scripts if necessary:
   chmod +x <script_name>
4. Run scripts:
   ./<script_name>

### Notes

- Each script corresponds to a specific task in the system engineering and DevOps curriculum.
- Ensure environment variables and input files are set or present if required by the scripts.
- Follow naming conventions strictly for compatibility with the auto-checker.
